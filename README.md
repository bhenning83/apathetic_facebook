<h2>Apathetic Facebook</h2>

This a project suggested by <a href='theodinproject.com'>The Odin Project</a>. The <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project'>project description</a> gave a list of features to consider, but the implementation was entirely my own. I was eager to carry on with the curriculum upon completion, but I intend to go back to add the ability to comment on comments, search for other users (which became necessary after dozens have created accounts on the app!!), and upload media to posts. Logging in through Facebook works properly, but imported profile pictures don't display properly. 


Created with JavaScript. View it live <a href='https://warm-everglades-80886.herokuapp.com/'>here</a>.*

\*Note: It's hosted for free on Heroku. If the app is unused for awhile it is unloaded from their server's memory. So the initial load time might be pretty sluggish.
